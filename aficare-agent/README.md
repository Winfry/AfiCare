Project Status:
This appears to be a project template/skeleton - the directory structure has been created but most files are currently empty. It's set up as a foundation for building a sophisticated medical AI system that can operate offline in resource-constrained environments while providing evidence-based medical guidance.

The project is designed to be particularly valuable in African healthcare settings where internet connectivity might be limited but AI-assisted medical decision support is needed.
